## 1. Incident Management Lifecycle
- **Detection**: Use SLI/SLO alerts to identify issues.
- **Triage**: Determine severity (P0, P1, P2) and impact.
- **Declaration**: Declare the incident and assign roles (Commander, Comms, Ops).
- **Resolution**: Mitigate the symptoms first, solve the root cause second.

---

## 2. Smart Diagnosis & Rapid Fix
- **Hypothesis Loop**: Investigate logs, traces, and metrics to form a hypothesis.
- **Verification**: Test the hypothesis with safe, reversible actions.
- **Fix**: Rollback if the last deployment was the culprit, or apply a hotfix. **Safety first.**

---

## 3. Runbook Execution & Automation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Follow pre-defined runbooks for common issues (DB Overload, Redis crash).
- **Automation**: Script repetitive recovery tasks.
- **Validation**: After mitigation, run smoke tests to ensure service stability.

---

## 4. Communication & Stakeholder Management
- **Internal**: Provide regular updates (every 15-30 mins) to the team.
- **External**: Update Status Page for customers.
- **Clarity**: Use clear language (e.g., "Investigating DB latency" vs "The app is down").

---

## 5. Blameless Post-Mortems & Learning
- **Blameless Culture**: Focus on "How" and "Why" the system failed, not "Who" made the mistake.
- **Timeline**: Document exactly what happened and when.
- **Action Items**: Define specific, trackable items to prevent recurrence.

---

## 🛠️ Execution Protocol

1. **Check System Health**: Run a quick diagnostic of the target service.
   ```bash
   python .agent/skills/incident-responder/scripts/health_check.py http://localhost:3000
   ```
2. **Isolate Issue**: Map the failure to specific logs or metrics.
3. **Remediate**: Apply the fix and verify system stability.
5. **Step 5: Document**: Start the Post-Mortem.
