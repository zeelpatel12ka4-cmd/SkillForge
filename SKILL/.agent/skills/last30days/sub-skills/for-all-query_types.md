# For all QUERY_TYPEs

Identify from the ACTUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT:

- **PROMPT FORMAT** - Does research recommend JSON, structured params, natural language, keywords? THIS IS CRITICAL.
- The top 3-5 patterns/techniques that appeared across multiple sources
- Specific keywords, structures, or approaches mentioned BY THE SOURCES
- Common pitfalls mentioned BY THE SOURCES

**If research says "use JSON prompts" or "structured prompts", you MUST deliver prompts in that format later.**

---

## THEN: Show Summary + Invite Vision

**CRITICAL: Do NOT output any "Sources:" lists. The final display should be clean.**

**Display in this EXACT sequence:**

**FIRST - What I learned (based on QUERY_TYPE):**

**If RECOMMENDATIONS** - Show specific things mentioned:

```
🏆 Most mentioned:
1. [Specific name] - mentioned {n}x (r/sub, @handle, blog.com)
2. [Specific name] - mentioned {n}x (sources)
3. [Specific name] - mentioned {n}x (sources)
4. [Specific name] - mentioned {n}x (sources)
5. [Specific name] - mentioned {n}x (sources)

Notable mentions: [other specific things with 1-2 mentions]
```

**If PROMPTING/NEWS/GENERAL** - Show synthesis and patterns:

```
What I learned:

[2-4 sentences synthesizing key insights FROM THE ACTUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT.]

KEY PATTERNS I'll use:
1. [Pattern from research]
2. [Pattern from research]
3. [Pattern from research]
```

**THEN - Stats (right before invitation):**

For **full/partial mode** (has API keys):

```
---
✅ All agents reported back!
├─ 🟠 Reddit: {n} threads │ {sum} upvotes │ {sum} comments
├─ 🔵 X: {n} posts │ {sum} likes │ {sum} reposts
├─ 🌐 Web: {n} pages │ {domains}
└─ Top voices: r/{sub1}, r/{sub2} │ @{handle1}, @{handle2} │ {web_author} on {site}
```

For **web-only mode** (no API keys):

```
---
✅ Research complete!
├─ 🌐 Web: {n} pages │ {domains}
└─ Top sources: {author1} on {site1}, {author2} on {site2}

💡 Want engagement metrics? Add API keys to ~/.config/last30days/.env
   - OPENAI_API_KEY → Reddit (real upvotes & comments)
   - XAI_API_KEY → X/Twitter (real likes & reposts)
```

**LAST - Invitation:**

```
---
Share your vision for what you want to create and I'll write a thoughtful prompt you can copy-paste directly into {TARGET_TOOL}.
```

**Use real numbers from the research output.** The patterns should be actual insights from the research, not generic advice.

**SELF-CHECK before displaying**: Re-read your "What I learned" section. Does it match what the research ACTUALLY says? If the research was about ClawdBot (a self-hosted AI agent), your summary should be about ClawdBot, not Claude Code. If you catch yourself projecting your own knowledge instead of the research, rewrite it.

**IF TARGET_TOOL is still unknown after showing results**, ask NOW (not before research):

```
What tool will you use these prompts with?

Options:
1. [Most relevant tool based on research - e.g., if research mentioned Figma/Sketch, offer those]
2. Nano Banana Pro (image generation)
3. ChatGPT / Claude (text/code)
4. Other (tell me)
```

**IMPORTANT**: After displaying this, WAIT for the user to respond. Don't dump generic prompts.

## WAIT FOR USER'S VISION

After showing the stats summary with your invitation, **STOP and wait** for the user to tell you what they want to create.

When they respond with their vision (e.g., "I want a landing page mockup for my SaaS app"), THEN write a single, thoughtful, tailored prompt.

---

## WHEN USER SHARES THEIR VISION: Write ONE Perfect Prompt

Based on what they want to create, write a **single, highly-tailored prompt** using your research expertise.
