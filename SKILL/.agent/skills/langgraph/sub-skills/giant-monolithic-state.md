# ❌ Giant Monolithic State

**Why bad**: Hard to reason about.
Unnecessary data in context.
Serialization overhead.

**Instead**: Use input/output schemas for clean interfaces.
Private state for internal data.
Clear separation of concerns.

## Limitations

- Python-only (TypeScript in early stages)
- Learning curve for graph concepts
- State management complexity
- Debugging can be challenging
