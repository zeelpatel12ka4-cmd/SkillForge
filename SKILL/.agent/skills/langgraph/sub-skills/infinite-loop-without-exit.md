# ❌ Infinite Loop Without Exit

**Why bad**: Agent loops forever.
Burns tokens and costs.
Eventually errors out.

**Instead**: Always have exit conditions:
- Max iterations counter in state
- Clear END conditions in routing
- Timeout at application level

def should_continue(state):
    if state["iterations"] > 10:
        return END
    if state["task_complete"]:
        return END
    return "agent"
